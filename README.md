### Introduction

Hi ,

Myself, SItanshu, B.tech(CSE) Ist year at Amrita University, Amritapuri. I live in Hyderabad, Telangana. 

I enjoy coding and learning  new technologies, as i grew up in a family of coders so I have really developed huge interest in programming.

I came across amFOSS from Quora which made me take admission in Amrita. 

I have lived in various cities for quite some years so I enjoy working on projects with different people, for which I want to be part of the club. Looking forward to be a member of this club.

### Experience with Tasks

After doing these tasks , I have realised the potential of programming in the real world. Most of the Tasks were well structured and were challenging. I have learnt lot of stuff while doing  these tasks.
